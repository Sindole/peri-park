With respect to items sold by Peripherals-Park, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Peripherals-Park is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.

We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites).

</p>

<h4 align="center"><b>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">The peripherals-park services and all information, content, materials, products (including software) and other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the peripherals-park services are provided by peripherals-park on an "as is" and "as available" basis, unless otherwise specified in writing. Peripherals-park makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the peripherals-park services, or the information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the peripherals-park services, unless otherwise specified in writing. You expressly agree that your use of the peripherals-park services is at your sole risk.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
To the full extent permissible by law, peripherals-park disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Peripherals-park does not warrant that the peripherals-park services, information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the peripherals-park services, peripherals-park's servers or electronic communications sent from peripherals-park are free of viruses or other harmful components. To the full extent permissible by law, peripherals-park will not be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of any peripherals-park service, or from any information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through any peripherals-park service, including, but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential damages, unless otherwise specified in writing.
</p>
<h4 align="center"><b>DISPUTES</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Peripherals-Park Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Peripherals-Park or through peri-park.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Peripherals-Park will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
</p>

<h4 align="center"><b>APPLICABLE LAW</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">By using any Peripherals-Park Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Peripherals-Park.
</p>

We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time.
